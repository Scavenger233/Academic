- DBMS: database management system
- query optimization

### SQL

#### Definition
- primarily a query language
- also a data definition component

#### Constraints
- names/identifiers:
  - no longer than 128 characters
  - must start with a letter
  - contain no spaces
  
#### SQL data types
  - Boolean: BOOLEAN
  - Character: 
     - CHAR(n ) = **fixed-length** string of n  characters.
     - VARCHAR(n ) = **variable-length** string of up to n  characters.
  - Numeric: NUMERIC, DECIMAL, INTEGER, SMALLINT, FLOAT, REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION
  - Datetime: DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP

#### Values
- Integers and reals (i.e. floating point numbers) are represented as you would expect
- Strings are too, except they require single quotes
- Any value can be **NULL**

### Schemas

- A database schema is structure that represents the logical storage of the data in a database.

### Primary Key/Unique

- There can be only one PRIMARY KEY for a relation, but several UNIQUE attributes.
- No attribute of a PRIMARY KEY can ever be NULL in any tuple.  But attributes declared UNIQUE may have NULL values, and there may be several tuples with NULL.

- Meaning of Single-Relation Query
  - Begin with the relation in the FROM clause.
  - Apply the selection indicated by the WHERE clause.
  - Apply the projection indicated by the SELECT clause.

#### Pattern

- A condition can compare a string to a pattern by:
  -  Attribute LIKE pattern or 
  -  Attribute NOT LIKE pattern
    
```sql
   SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```
#### NULL values

- Missing value : e.g., we know a customer has some address, but we donâ€™t know what it is.
- Inapplicable : e.g., the value of attribute name of spouse for an unmarried person.

#### Comparing NULLs to values

- The logic of conditions in SQL is really 3-valued logic: TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN.
- Comparing any value (including NULL itself) with NULL yields UNKNOWN.
- A tuple is in a query answer if and only if the WHERE clause is TRUE (not FALSE or UNKNOWN).

#### Three-Valued Logic

- 2-Valued Laws != 3-Valued Laws
- See details in [here](logic.md)

#### Multiiteration Queries

- Distinguish attributes of the same name by **relation.attribute**

```
SELECT Employees.name, Departments.name
FROM Employees, Departments;
```
