The slide on "Transaction Management" from your lecture explains how databases manage multiple users and processes accessing and updating data at the same time. Here’s a simple summary to help with your exam preparation:

1. **Why Transactions?**
   - Transactions are necessary because many users or processes might access and modify the database simultaneously. This requires a system to manage such interactions without issues.

2. **Definition of a Transaction:**
   - A transaction is a sequence of actions (like read or update) performed by a user or a program that treats the series of actions as a single unit. This means the transaction either completes fully or not at all, ensuring the database remains consistent.

3. **ACID Properties of Transactions:**
   - **Atomicity:** The entire transaction is completed or none of it is.
   - **Consistency:** The transaction must meet all database rules.
   - **Isolation:** The effects of an incomplete transaction are not visible to other transactions.
   - **Durability:** Once a transaction is complete, the changes are permanent, even if there's a system failure.

4. **SQL Support for Transactions:**
   - Commands like `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` help manage transactions in SQL. `COMMIT` finalizes the changes, while `ROLLBACK` undoes them if there's an error or at the user's request.

5. **Concurrency Control:**
   - This is about managing transactions from multiple users so they don’t interfere with each other. It aims to prevent issues like lost updates, uncommitted data being used, or inconsistent data reads.

6. **Concurrency Control Techniques:**
   - **Locking:** Ensures that when one transaction is using a piece of data, others cannot change it.
   - **Timestamping:** Orders transactions based on their start times to manage conflicts.
   - **Optimistic Techniques:** Allow transactions to proceed without locking and check for conflicts only at the end.
