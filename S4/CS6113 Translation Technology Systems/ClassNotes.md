## Process
### Definition
- A series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular end
- Repeated/repeatable
### Perspectives
- Process-view
- Data-view
- Resource-view
- Application-view
- Exception-view

## Model
### Definition
- A model is a **simplified** or **partial representation** of reality, defined in order to _accomplish a task_ or to _reach an agreement_.
  - is based on an original **(Mapping Feature)**
  - only reflects a (relevant) selection of the originalâ€™s properties. **(Reduction Feature)**
  - needs to be usable in place of an original with respect to some purpose **(Pragmatic Feature)**

### Abstraction
- generalisation
- classification
- aggregation


### Descriptive Use
-  as documentation
-  as mathematical structures
-  as drafts
-  as guidelines
-  as programs

## Flowcharts
- Typically **directed graphs**, i.e., diagrams consisting of:
  - nodes
  - directed edges

### Types
- processing step(rectangular box)
- decision(diamond)

### Control-flow Patterns
- sequence

- Parallel Split
  - The **divergence of a branch** into two or more parallel branches **each of which execute concurrently**.

- Synchronisation
  - The **convergence** of two or more branches into a single subsequent branch such that the thread of control is passed to the subsequent branch **when all input branches have been enabled**.

- Exclusive Choice 
  - The **divergence of a branch** into two or more branches such that when the incoming branch is enabled, the thread of control is immediately passed to **precisely one of the outgoing branches** based on a mechanism that can select one of the outgoing branches

- Simple Merge
  - The **convergence of two or more branches** into a single subsequent branch such that **each enablement of an incoming branch** results in the thread of control being passed to the subsequent branch

- Loop
  - The ability to **execute a task or sub-process repeatedly**. The loop has either a **pre-test or post-test condition** associated with it that is either evaluated at the beginning or end of the loop to determine whether it should continue. The looping structure has a **single entry and exit point**.
    - while loop (pre-test loop construct)
    - repeat loop(post-test loop)
